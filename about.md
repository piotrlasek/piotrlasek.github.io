Hi and welcome to my website!
</p>
<p>
I'm a computer scientist and
data analytics enthusiast with
more than ten years hands-on experience
in <i>programming</i>, <i>software design</i> and
<i>data mining</i>.
I'm experienced in all the design,
implementation and testing stages
of building a software product
and took part in several
research projects concerning text mining,
semi-automatic ontology building and data clustering.
</p>
<p>
Recently, I've been mostly interested in
<i>interactive database visualization</i>,
<i>knowledge-based data clustering</i>
and <i>revenue management</i> techniques.
</p>
<p>
Since August 2014 until July 2016, I've been a <i>Postdoctoral Fellow</i>
at the York University (Toronto) working in the database lab
on new methods of efficient and interactive database
visualization.

Currently, an <i>Assistant Professor</i> at the University of Rzeszow.
